		<h5>Top 100 Judges</h5>
		<p>Research shows that one in five children in South Africa is bullied before they finish secondary school and just over 33% are diagnosed with depression before the age of fourteen, bullying being one of the causes. The reason  bullying thrives and leaves children depressed and helpless is due to a lack of awareness and understanding of what bullying is.</p>
		<p>Core elements of the definition of bullying include unwanted aggressive behavior or perceived power imbalances and high repetition  or repeatability.</p>
		<p>The South African education system views bullying as a conflict while research confirms that it is a form of violence and peer abuse. Currently, there are no adequate measures  to restore and build character  for  children who are bullied and victims of bullying. </p>
		<p>Our foundation offers the Leadership Anti-Bullying Leadership program to help eradicate bullying in schools. The program is designed to protect children from bullying, empower those who have been  bullied in the past, and  provide remedial action for children who exhibit antisocial and potential bullying behavior. others or have  bullied others in the past. The program includes an introduction to chess and coding as remedial activities. Both of these activities are supported by solid research on how their long-term use improves thinking and problem-solving skills, traits to be improved in children who bully others. as well as children who are vulnerable to bullying.</p>
		<p>The show also offers character-building quests with six matching personal values. Children will have to complete one task each month, so the program will last six months. Leaders will also be motivated to raise funds individually and in groups for a good cause.</p>
