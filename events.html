			<p id="notes">Ipeleng cares foundation is offering a leaders against bullying, leadership program to help eradicate bullying in schools. The program is designed to bully-proof children, empower children who have been previously bullied and to provide corrective measures to children who have anti-social behaviour and are likely to bully others or have already bullied others. The program includes introduction to chess and coding as remedial activities. These two activities have a backed research of how over prolonged use they help improve thinking and problem solving skills, characteristics that need to be enhanced in children who bully others as well those who are prone to be victims of bullying.
